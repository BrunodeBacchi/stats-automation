# Stats Automation

In this automation, we took a website that lists characteristics of the game "Super Smash Bros." The automation fetches the list of characteristics that provides us with the values for each character and selects the highest and lowest values. It does this for two lists: [Gravity](cypress/e2e/gravity.spec.cy.js) and [Air Speed](cypress/e2e/airspeed.spec.cy.js). In addition, it also captures the highest and lowest and shows you the character's page. You can visit the website [here](https://ultimateframedata.com) if you wish.
