# Stats Automation

In this automation, we took a website that lists characteristics of the game "Super Smash Bros." The automation fetches the list of characteristics that provides us with the values for each character and selects the highest and lowest values. It does this for two lists, with de higher and lower character: The [higher of the Gravity table](cypress/e2e/gravityH.spec.cy.js) and the [lower of the gravity table](/cypress/e2e/gravityL.spec.cy.js). The [higher of the air speed table](cypress/e2e/airspeedH.spec.cy.js) and the [lower of the air speed table](/cypress/e2e/airspeedL.spec.cy.js). In addition, it also captures the highest and lowest and shows you the character's page. You can visit the website [here](https://ultimateframedata.com) if you wish.
